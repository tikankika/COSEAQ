# COSEAQ-C Collaborative Workflow

## How Teacher-AI Collaboration Works

### 1. **Initial Analysis Phase**
```
Teacher: @coseaq-c start biology grade 9
AI: "I'll help analyze your curriculum. Where are your curriculum files?"

Teacher: "They're in /Users/name/Documents/Curriculum/"
AI: @coseaq-c list files in that directory
    "Found: Biology-NC.pdf, Biology-Syllabus.docx"
    "May I read these files?" [Requests permission]
    
Teacher: [Approves access]
AI: @coseaq-c reads files and analyzes
    "Found 15 competencies, 28 objectives, 12 topics"
    "What would you like to adjust?"
    
Teacher: "Focus more on practical lab skills"
AI: [Updates analysis, re-prioritizes competencies]
```

### 2. **Interactive Refinement**
```
AI: "Based on the curriculum, I suggest these 8 chapters:"
    [Shows suggested outline]
    "Questions for you:"
    - "Which topics do students struggle with most?"
    - "Any local examples you want to include?"
    - "Preferred sequence for lab work?"

Teacher: "Chapter 3 should come before Chapter 2, and we need more ecology"
AI: [Reorganizes outline, expands ecology content]
    "Updated! Here's the revised structure. Shall we detail Chapter 1?"
```

### 3. **Chapter Development**
```
AI: "For Chapter 1 - Cell Biology, I suggest:"
    - 15 key concepts
    - 4 lab activities
    - 3 discussion topics
    "What would you add or change?"

Teacher: "Add microscopy skills and reduce concepts to 10"
AI: [Adjusts chapter plan]
    "Done! Should we include digital microscopy resources?"
```

### 4. **Continuous Feedback Loop**
```
Teacher: "The difficulty progression is too steep"
AI: "I'll redistribute complex concepts. Which ones specifically?"
    [Shows concept difficulty mapping]

Teacher: [Selects concepts to move]
AI: "Reorganized! The progression is now more gradual."
```

## Key Collaboration Features

### ðŸ’¬ **Dialogue-Driven**
- AI asks specific questions at each step
- Teacher input directly shapes the output
- No automatic decisions without teacher approval

### ðŸ”„ **Iterative Refinement**
- Teacher can modify any AI suggestion
- Changes propagate through the entire structure
- Version history tracks all modifications

### ðŸ’¾ **Session Persistence**
- Work is saved after each step
- Can pause and resume anytime
- Share sessions with colleagues

### ðŸŽ¯ **Teacher Control Points**
1. **Approval Gates**: Major decisions require explicit approval
2. **Override Options**: Teacher can override any AI suggestion
3. **Custom Additions**: Add local content, examples, methods

## Example Commands

```bash
# Start a new session
@coseaq-c start mathematics grade 7

# Review AI analysis
@coseaq-c show analysis

# Modify suggestions
@coseaq-c adjust chapter 3 "Add more problem-solving"

# Save progress
@coseaq-c save session

# Resume later
@coseaq-c resume session-id
```

## Why This Works Better

1. **Teacher Expertise + AI Efficiency**: Combines human insight with AI's processing power
2. **Contextual Understanding**: AI learns teacher's preferences throughout session
3. **Practical Output**: Results in curriculum that's both compliant and teachable
4. **Time-Saving**: Reduces planning time from days to hours
