# Generate Questions for Essays and Quizes - Theoretical approach #GQEQT

## Welcome to a project designed to enhance the process of creating questions for Essays and Quizes through detailed instructions and specific commands tailored for GPT. 

There are 5 different Phases that have specific functions. Each Phase have specific commands that are structured set of "micro-prompts" and you move on to next by **"Commands"** 
<ol>
  <li>#GQEQT Phase 1 - Develop Distractors and Alignment</li> 
  <li>#GQEQT Phase 2 - Questions for Exams and Study</li>  
  <li>#GQEQT Phase 3 - Forumulate Assesment instructions</li> 
  <li>#GQEQT Phase 4 - QUIZ Questions Generation</li> 
  <li>#GQEQT Phase 5 - QUIZ Questions Evaluation (Beta)</li> 
</ol>


**Start with **Phase 1** and change between the different Phases:**

## Brief information / Quickstart!

### **Phase 1** 
Focuses on analyzing the concept i textbooks to pinpointing misconceptions, and aligning with the curriculum to establish clear assessment goals. The focus is on Misconception Identification, alongside ensuring Curriculum Alignment.
<br> **Upload:** Textbook, curriculum and choose one or a few concepts... <br/> 
### Commands: 
  <ol>
      <li>Concept_Analysis</li>
      <li>Execute  </li>
    	<li>READ </li>
    	<li>BREAKDOWN  </li>
  </ol>

 


###**Phase 2** 
Design Essay, Quiz and Study questions on a specific concept, ensuring depth and clarity. Include plausible distractors, grading levels, and comprehensive feedback
### Commands:
    <ol>
      <li>DEVISE_QUESTIONS: to create questions assessing comprehension and understanding of specific concepts, including semantic intricacies.</li>
      <li>DEVELOP_DISTRACTORS:  to generate plausible distractors based on common misunderstandings, aiming to challenge students to accurately differentiate between closely related concepts.</li>
      <li>FEEDBACK_FOR_QUESTIONS:  to provide detailed explanations for the correct answers, clarifying the reasoning behind each distractor's plausibility and addressing misconceptions.</li>
      <li>FORMULATE_QUESTIONS:  to devise additional questions that deepen engagement with the subject matter, promoting critical thinking and application of knowledge.</li>
      <li>STUDY_QUESTIONS:  to generate a set of study questions intended for revision and deeper understanding of the subject matter, exploring different aspects of the concept or area being studied.</li>
      <li>PRINT_QUESTIONS:  to compile and print all developed questions, including quiz questions, study questions, distractors, and feedback, offering a comprehensive study and revision tool.</li>
    </ol>


## Phase 3 *BETA!*
This GPT helps generate precise assessment guidelines based on E, C, A grading criteria. It outlines steps for policy review, points allocation, and guideline development, focusing on clarity, fairness, and educational alignment.
### Commands:
STEPS_FOR_GENERATION:  to initiate the process of generating detailed assessment guidelines, including the review of policy documents, consideration of maximum points, and the balance between question complexity and points allocated.

RESPONSE_EXAMPLES: to develop examples of student responses that illustrate different levels of understanding and meet the assessment criteria for grades E, C, and A.

ASSESSMENT_TABLE:  to design a table detailing each task with criteria for scoring and points allocation, facilitating assessment and grading.

## Phase 4
Generate quiz questions with analytical depth, including plausible distractors and detailed feedback, focusing on a specific concept. Structure questions across difficulty levels E, C, and A, directly engaging with educational material for comprehensive assessment.

QUIZ_QUESTIONS: for the entire quiz question generation process, including opening the code environment, picking concepts, and creating a question table.
### Commands:
    <ul>
      <li>DEVISE_QUESTIONS: To develop questions with depth, based on educational standards and textbook content.</li>
      <li>DEVELOP_DISTRACTORS: To create plausible distractors based on common misunderstandings related to the quiz questions.</li>
      <li>FEEDBACK_FOR_QUESTIONS: To provide explanations for the correct answers and detail why distractors are incorrect, aimed at enhancing understanding.</li>
    </ul>

## Phase 5 *BETA!*
Evaluate quiz questions through a comprehensive analysis framework focusing on plausibility of distractors, question uniqueness, answer option balance, and distractor variation to ensure educational value and effective knowledge application testing.
### Commands:
    <ul>
      <li>Duplicates: Execute &lt;Analyze_Duplicates&gt; to identify duplicate questions.</li>
      <li>Balance: Execute &lt;Analyze_Balance&gt; to ensure answer options are balanced and no option stands out.</li>
      <li>Similarities: Execute &lt;Analyze_Similarities&gt; to find questions with high content or structural similarity.</li>
      <li>Plausibility: Execute &lt;Analyze_Plausibility&gt; to assess the plausibility of incorrect answers.</li>
      <li>Distractors: Execute &lt;Assess_Distractors&gt; to analyze the variety among distractors for each question.</li>
      <li>Report_Findings: Execute &lt;Report_Findings&gt; to compile findings and recommendations for improving quiz questions.</li>
    </ul>
