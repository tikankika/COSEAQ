# Generate Questions for Essays and Quizes - Theoretical approach #GQEQT

## Welcome to a project designed to enhance the process of creating questions for Essays and Quizes through detailed instructions and specific commands tailored for GPT. 

There are 5 different Phases that have specific functions. Each Phase have specific commands that are structured set of "micro-prompts" and you move on to next by **"Commands"** 
<ul>
 <li>GQEQT Phase 1 - Develop Distractors and Alignment: Focus on creating plausible distractors and ensuring alignment with learning objectives.</li>
  <li>GQEQT Phase 2 - Questions for Exams and Study: Develop questions aimed at assessing comprehension and application of knowledge for exams and study purposes.</li>
  <li>GQEQT Phase 3 - Formulate Assessment Instructions: Design detailed instructions for assessments to guide both educators and students.</li>
  <li>GQEQT Phase 4 - QUIZ Questions Generation: Generate quiz questions that thoroughly test understanding of specific concepts, including creating distractors and providing feedback.</li>
  <li>GQEQT Phase 5 - QUIZ Questions Evaluation (Beta): A beta phase focused on rigorously evaluating the generated quiz questions for plausibility, balance, and educational value.</li>
</ul>

## Brief information / Quickstart!

### **Phase 1** 
Focuses on analyzing the concept i textbooks to pinpointing misconceptions, and aligning with the curriculum to establish clear assessment goals. The focus is on Misconception Identification, alongside ensuring Curriculum Alignment.
<br> **Upload:** Textbook, curriculum and choose one or a few concepts... <br/> 
#### Commands: 
      Concept_Analysis
      Execute  
    	READ 
    	BREAKDOWN  
  

 
###**Phase 2** 
Design Essay, Quiz and Study questions on a specific concept, ensuring depth and clarity. Include plausible distractors, grading levels, and comprehensive feedback
#### Commands:
    
      DEVISE_QUESTIONS: to create questions assessing comprehension and understanding of specific concepts, including semantic intricacies.
      DEVELOP_DISTRACTORS:  to generate plausible distractors based on common misunderstandings, aiming to challenge students to accurately differentiate between closely related concepts.
      FEEDBACK_FOR_QUESTIONS:  to provide detailed explanations for the correct answers, clarifying the reasoning behind each distractor's plausibility and addressing misconceptions.
      FORMULATE_QUESTIONS:  to devise additional questions that deepen engagement with the subject matter, promoting critical thinking and application of knowledge.
      STUDY_QUESTIONS:  to generate a set of study questions intended for revision and deeper understanding of the subject matter, exploring different aspects of the concept or area being studied.
      PRINT_QUESTIONS:  to compile and print all developed questions, including quiz questions, study questions, distractors, and feedback, offering a comprehensive study and revision tool.
    </ol>


### Phase 3 *BETA!*
This GPT helps generate precise assessment guidelines based on E, C, A grading criteria. It outlines steps for policy review, points allocation, and guideline development, focusing on clarity, fairness, and educational alignment.
#### Commands:
        STEPS_FOR_GENERATION:  to initiate the process of generating detailed assessment guidelines, including the review of policy documents, consideration of maximum points, and the balance between question complexity and points allocated.
        RESPONSE_EXAMPLES: to develop examples of student responses that illustrate different levels of understanding and meet the assessment criteria for grades E, C, and A.        
        ASSESSMENT_TABLE:  to design a table detailing each task with criteria for scoring and points allocation, facilitating assessment and grading.

### Phase 4
Generate quiz questions with analytical depth, including plausible distractors and detailed feedback, focusing on a specific concept. Structure questions across difficulty levels E, C, and A, directly engaging with educational material for comprehensive assessment.


#### Commands:
      QUIZ_QUESTIONS: for the entire quiz question generation process, including opening the code environment, picking concepts, and creating a question table.
      DEVISE_QUESTIONS: To develop questions with depth, based on educational standards and textbook content.
      DEVELOP_DISTRACTORS: To create plausible distractors based on common misunderstandings related to the quiz questions.
      FEEDBACK_FOR_QUESTIONS: To provide explanations for the correct answers and detail why distractors are incorrect, aimed at enhancing understanding.
    

### Phase 5 *BETA!*
Evaluate quiz questions through a comprehensive analysis framework focusing on plausibility of distractors, question uniqueness, answer option balance, and distractor variation to ensure educational value and effective knowledge application testing.
#### Commands:

      Duplicates:  to identify duplicate questions.
      Balance:  to ensure answer options are balanced and no option stands out.
      Similarities:  to find questions with high content or structural similarity.
      Plausibility:  to assess the plausibility of incorrect answers.
      Distractors:  to analyze the variety among distractors for each question.
      Report_Findings:  to compile findings and recommendations for improving quiz questions.
