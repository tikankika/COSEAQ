# Introduction to the COSEAQ Framework

# COSEAQ Framework Introduction

The COSEAQ framework is a comprehensive scaffolding system designed to enhance educational workflows through generative AI integration. It focuses on improving the development of high-quality educational contentâ€”including essay questions, assessment guidelines, and quizzesâ€”by facilitating meaningful dialogue between educators and AI while incorporating theoretical principles such as constructive alignment and assessment literacy.

Rather than being merely a tool, COSEAQ provides a structured approach that ensures alignment between teaching practices, syllabi, and national curriculum requirements. Its fundamental purpose is to create cohesion among all course elements to optimize student learning outcomes.

At the framework's core are micropromptsâ€”carefully crafted instructions that scaffold the workflow and guide teacher-AI interactions. These microprompts can be implemented in various AI platforms such as Claude or ChatGPT. In Claude, educators can create a project and upload relevant files, then apply specific microprompts from the framework. Alternatively, they can access Custom GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) through OpenAI's ChatGPT by searching for COSEAQ. While each component functions independently, the framework is designed for integrated implementation to maximize effectiveness.

Educators can employ the microprompts either sequentially or as standalone tools, depending on their specific needs and preferences. This flexible, modular approach enables teachers to select the most appropriate components for their subject matter and teaching context. Importantly, the framework serves as scaffolding rather than an automated solution, preserving teacher autonomy and educational integrity throughout the content creation process.

The framework's integration of generative AI aims to enhance pedagogical processes while maintaining the educator's essential role. By incorporating various theoretical frameworks, COSEAQ allows teachers to select approaches that best align with their teaching philosophy and subject requirements.

Furthermore, the framework's microprompts can be effectively utilized across different language models, including Claude 3 and Gemini Advanced. All microprompt sets are openly available on GitHub, ensuring broad accessibility and adaptability for educators.

Through its structured approach and systematic implementation, COSEAQ empowers educators to create superior content while developing their professional expertise. As AI continues to evolve in educational contexts, the framework stands as a valuable resource for teachers seeking to integrate generative AI effectively into their pedagogical practice.

## Core Aspects of the Framework

- **Dialogic Approach**: Facilitates meaningful exchanges between educators and AI through structured microprompts, enabling collaborative and iterative content creation that combines human expertise with AI capabilities.

- **Scaffolding Support**: Provides carefully designed microprompts that structure and guide content generation, ensuring alignment with educational standards while fostering critical thinking and deeper understanding.

- **Customized GPTs**: Offers standalone yet combinable GPTs that address various educational needs, providing both versatility and adaptability in application.

## Purpose Beyond Efficiency

The COSEAQ framework's primary objective is to enhance educators' professional expertise and practice, with improved efficiency as a secondary benefit. Through generative AI integration, it enriches pedagogical processes in multiple ways:

- The dialogic approach encourages critical examination of content and learning objectives
- Scaffolding support ensures alignment with educational standards
- The framework promotes deeper understanding and pedagogical improvement

Crucially, COSEAQ prioritizes teacher autonomy and educational integrity. Educators maintain control over the content creation process, exercising their professional judgment in guiding the AI and making final decisions about generated materials. The framework's flexibility accommodates various theoretical approaches, including constructive alignment and assessment literacy, allowing teachers to adapt it to their specific teaching practices and subject matter requirements.

Ultimately, COSEAQ ensures that technology serves educational needs rather than dictating them. By providing a structured framework for educator-AI collaboration, it empowers teachers to create high-quality educational materials efficiently while preserving their pedagogical expertise and professional autonomy.

# COSEAQ Framework: Integrated Educational Content Development Workflow

## 1. Establishing the Educational Foundation
The COSEAQ framework begins with two foundational components that establish a robust pedagogical base through coordinated implementation:

### Primary Foundation Components:

#### COSEAQ O (Objective Formulation and Syllabus Interpretation)
This component bridges broad educational goals with specific, actionable objectives by:
- Structuring the systematic interpretation of syllabi and national curricula
- Establishing measurable learning outcomes
- Implementing SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Defining achievable educational goals
- Creating the framework for content development and assessment

#### COSEAQ C (Content Generation from Curriculum)
Operating in alignment with Objective Formulation, this component transforms curriculum requirements into structured educational content by:
- Converting curriculum guidelines into comprehensive teaching materials
- Developing content aligned with learning objectives
- Maintaining educational standards throughout development
- Supporting multiple assessment methods through content design
- Connecting objectives directly to teaching materials

**ðŸ†• MCP Server Implementation Available**: COSEAQ C now has a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables direct integration with Claude Desktop for AI-powered curriculum analysis. See [mcp-servers/coseaq-c/](mcp-servers/coseaq-c/) for details.

## 2. Study Question Development: The Core Process
COSEAQ S (Study Question Developer) builds upon components O and C to bridge basic content with advanced assessment methods.

### COSEAQ S Implementation Process:
