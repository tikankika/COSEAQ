" To generate detailed assessment guidelines for a question, considering the criteria for grades E, C, and A, it's crucial to be as detailed as possible while also being concise and precise. Below is a structured approach incorporating these grading criteria:

<Say> Ask for relevant criteria

# Introduction to Assessment Guidelines
#Purpose of Guidelines: To ensure fair, objective evaluation aligned with educational standards, facilitating effective assessment of student responses.
#Preparation for Guideline Development: Policy Document Interpretation: Review and interpret policy documents and standards to ensure compliance and alignment with educational policies.

# Consideration of Maximum Points
<Say> Ask for points 
# Incorporation into Guidelines: Determine and incorporate maximum points for each assessment task, reflecting question complexity and educational objectives.
# Balance Between Complexity and Points: Balance the complexity of questions with allocated points to ensure fair reflection of student understanding.

# Generation of Detailed Assessment Guidelines
[Steps for Generation:]
    1. Develop clear and effective guidelines by incorporating insights from policy document reviews and student response evaluations.
    2. Be detailed in descriptions but concise in presentation.
    3. Incorporation of Educational Insights: Incorporate educational insights from the preparation phase, ensuring guidelines are informative, fair, and aligned with objectives.
    # Facilitation of Assessment and Grading: Ensure the table streamlines the assessment and grading process, making it transparent and applicable.

# Construction of Student Response Examples
[Response Examples]
      1. Development of Examples: Develop examples illustrating different levels of understanding and meeting the assessment criteria for grades E, C, and A.
      2. Utilization for Clarity and Expectation Setting: Use examples to set clear expectations and assist in consistent grading.



# Sequential Approach to Task Handling
One Task at a Time: Adopt a sequential approach, starting with question creation and progressing through the outlined steps.
Focused Development and Application: Focus on developing and applying each part of the guidelines to ensure they are comprehensive and effective.


# Creation of an Assessment Table
[Assessment Table]
Designing the Assessment Table: Design a table detailing each task, criteria for scoring, and points allocated for each criterion.


# Incorporating E, C, A Criteria
For Grade E: Define the minimum required understanding and application of knowledge for achieving grade E. Criteria should focus on basic comprehension and the ability to recall or reproduce information.
For Grade C: Set criteria that reflect a deeper understanding and the ability to apply knowledge in familiar contexts. Expectations should include analytical skills and the ability to make connections between concepts.
For Grade A: Criteria for grade A should demand a comprehensive understanding, critical thinking, and the ability to apply knowledge in new or complex situations. Expect a high level of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.
Each criterion for E, C, and A grades

# Review of Assessed Student Responses: Analyze previously assessed responses to identify common strengths and weaknesses, informing appropriate assessment levels and addressing misconceptions.
