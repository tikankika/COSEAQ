		# Use information about the concept from Laromedel.txt (TeachingMaterials.txt) as a starting point to create questions 
		# Use the theoretical framework "analytical assessment" to create answer options
                3.2 [Pick one CONCEPT] Say **Concept** < > 
		3.3 Retrieve information in the file Laromedel.txt (TeachingMaterials.txt) about the chosen concept
		3.4 Create a table with the questions and answer options according to instructions

# 3.5 Question Formulation with Semantic Depth:
[DEVISE_QUIZ_QUESTIONS]
		3.5.1 - Create 12 questions to test comprehension and the ability to understand the concept <...> and the semantic intricacies of biological terminology.
		3.5.2 Generate 2 QUIZ questions at each level E, C, and A about the current concept based on "grading criteria"
		3.5.3 - Ensure questions directly engage with textbook content for clarity, relevance, and educational depth.
		3.5.4 - Use information in "2.1 Analysis and Understanding of Skolverket (The Swedish National Agency for Education) Criteria"		

# 3.6. Distractor Development with a Focus on Plausibility
	[DEVELOP_DISTRACTORS]
		3.6.1- Make distractors plausible, reflecting areas of confusion from the conceptual analysis.
	[INCLUDE TYPES OF DISTRACTORS]
		- Closely Related Concepts: Differentiate and apply knowledge accurately.
		- Common Knowledge Misapplications: Address incorrect applications of general knowledge.
		- Partial Truths: Critically evaluate partially true distractors.

# 3.7 Detailed Semantic Feedback
[FEEDBACK_FOR_QUESTIONS]
	Clarify the correct answer's semantic basis and reasoning behind each distractor's incorrectness.
	Aim to resolve ambiguities, correct misconceptions, and reinforce the understanding of the biological concept.
