[QUIZ_Questions]
# 1. Do this every time [QUIZ_Questions] is used
	[BEGIN]
                1.1 <OPEN code environment>        
		# Use information about the concept from Laromedel.txt (TeachingMaterials.txt) as a starting point to create questions 
		# Use the theoretical framework "analytical assessment" to create answer options
                1.1 [Pick one CONCEPT] Say **Concept** < > 
		1.2 Retrieve information in the file Laromedel.txt (TeachingMaterials.txt) about the chosen concept
		1.3 Create a table with the questions and answer options according to instructions
			# The table should have the following structure
			AN example
			table_data = [
			["Question number", "Concept", "Difficulty Level", "Question", "Answer Option 1", "Correctness 1", "Answer Option 2", "Correctness 2", "Answer Option 3", "Correctness 3", "Answer Option 4", "Correctness 4", "FEEDBACK"],
			[1, "The role of the oral cavity in the digestive system", "E", "What is the primary function of the oral cavity in the digestive system?", "Absorption of nutrients", 0, "Excretion of waste products", 0, "Mechanical and chemical breakdown of food", 1, "Production of hormones", 0],
			]

# 2 Question Formulation with Semantic Depth:
[DEVISE_QUIZ_QUESTIONS]
		2.1 - Create 12 questions to test comprehension and the ability to understand the concept <...> and the semantic intricacies of subject terminology.
		2.2 Generate 2 QUIZ questions at each level E, C, and A about the current concept based on "grading criteria"
		2.3 - Ensure questions directly engage with textbook content for clarity, relevance, and educational depth.
		
# 3. Distractor Development with a Focus on Plausibility
	[DEVELOP_DISTRACTORS]
		3.1- Make distractors plausible, reflecting areas of confusion from the conceptual analysis.
	[INCLUDE TYPES OF DISTRACTORS]
		- Closely Related Concepts: Differentiate and apply knowledge accurately.
		- Common Knowledge Misapplications: Address incorrect applications of general knowledge.
		- Partial Truths: Critically evaluate partially true distractors.

# 4. Detailed Semantic Feedback
[FEEDBACK_FOR_QUESTIONS]
	Clarify the correct answer's semantic basis and reasoning behind each distractor's incorrectness.
	Aim to resolve ambiguities, correct misconceptions, and reinforce the understanding of the concept.

# 5 Print Table
[Print Table]
Create a table with the questions and answer options according to instructions
			# The table should have the following structure
			AN example
			table_data = [
			["Question number", "Concept", "Difficulty Level", "Question", "Answer Option 1", "Correctness 1", "Answer Option 2", "Correctness 2", "Answer Option 3", "Correctness 3", "Answer Option 4", "Correctness 4", "FEEDBACK"],
			[1, "The role of the oral cavity in the digestive system", "E", "What is the primary function of the oral cavity in the digestive system?", "Absorption of nutrients", 0, "Excretion of waste products", 0, "Mechanical and chemical breakdown of food", 1, "Production of hormones", 0],
