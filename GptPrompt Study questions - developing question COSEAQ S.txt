This method is highly effective for subjects where practical application is critical, such as sciences, social sciences, and business studies.

        ##### Implementation Strategy:
        - **Contextualization**: Begin by setting a detailed scenario that mirrors a real-life situation or a hypothetical yet plausible setting. This context should be rich enough to allow multiple angles of inquiry and should inherently connect to key learning objectives.
        - **Incorporation of Key Concepts**: Embed essential concepts within the scenario. For instance, a biology question might place students in a role of an ecologist analyzing a disrupted ecosystem, requiring them to apply knowledge of ecological principles to identify potential causes and consequences.    
        - **Problem-Solving Requirement**: Design the scenario so that it requires critical thinking and problem-solving. Ask students to identify problems, propose solutions, or predict outcomes based on their understanding of the subject matter.
        - **Reflection on Implications**: Encourage students to reflect on the broader implications of their analysis, such as ethical considerations, long-term effects, or potential real-world applications.
    
    #### 5.2 Incorporate Open-Ended Questions
    [Open-Ended]
        **Open-ended questions** require more than the mere recollection of facts; they ask students to construct responses based on a synthesis of knowledge, personal insights, and analytical skills. This question type is pivotal in assessing the depth of a studentâ€™s understanding and their ability to articulate it.
        ###### Implementation Strategy:
        - **Prompt Critical Thinking**: Craft prompts that ask for analysis, interpretation, or synthesis of information. For example, instead of asking what happened in a historical event, ask students to analyze the reasons behind the decisions made by key figures and how different choices could have changed the outcome.
        - **Encourage Detailed Responses**: Design questions that implicitly require detailed answers. Use lead-ins like "Explain how...", "Discuss the implications of...", or "Evaluate the effectiveness of..." to elicit comprehensive responses.
        - **Facilitate Personal Connection**: Allow students to bring personal experiences or prior knowledge into their answers. This not only makes learning more relevant but also helps in retaining information by connecting new knowledge to existing cognitive structures.
        - **Use of Real-World Problems**: Ask students to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems or to address current issues. This can help in developing their ability to transfer academic concepts to practical applications.
            
    ####  5.3  ##### 5.3.1 Integrate Critical Thinking Questions
    [Critical-Thinking]
        Creating questions that differentiate students' understanding requires crafting prompts that challenge them to employ higher-order cognitive skills. These skills, as defined by Bloom's taxonomy, include analyzing, evaluating, and creating. By focusing on critical thinking and comparative analysis, educators can design questions that not only assess knowledge but also deepen understanding and encourage a sophisticated approach to learning. 
        Critical thinking questions are designed to push students beyond mere recall, asking them to engage with content at a deeper level. This involves evaluation, analysis, and synthesis of information.
         
        ###### Implementation Strategy:
        - **Evaluation of Arguments**: Design questions that ask students to assess the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments. For instance, in a social studies class, you might present two different perspectives on a historical event and ask students to evaluate the validity of each perspective based on evidence.
        - **Analysis of Data**: Incorporate questions that require students to look at data sets or results from experiments and derive meaningful conclusions. In science education, for instance, you could provide experimental data and ask students to determine what the data suggests about a specific scientific theory.
        - **Critique of Methods**: Ask students to critique the methods used in studies or experiments. This could involve discussing whether the methodology was appropriate for the study's goals and what could have been done differently.
        - **Identification of Assumptions**: Challenge students to identify underlying assumptions in arguments or methodologies. This can help them understand how conclusions are formed and the basis on which theories are built.    
        - **Discerning Patterns**: Encourage students to look for patterns or trends in information, which can be particularly effective in subjects like mathematics, science, and social studies.
