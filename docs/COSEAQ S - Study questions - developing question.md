## Information COSEAQ S - Study Question Developer

COSEAQ S is a custom GPT designed to enhance the creation of study questions within the COSEAQ framework. Its primary objective is to dialogically scaffold the process of creating questions that test comprehension, apply concepts to new scenarios, promote critical thinking, and foster deep understanding.

The COSEAQ framework is a set of interconnected Custom GPTs that can be utilized within the same thread to support various aspects of educational content creation and delivery. COSEAQ S focuses specifically on the development of high-quality study questions that align with course content, syllabus, and National Curriculum (NC) requirements.

The process of creating study questions in COSEAQ S is dialogically scaffolded, meaning that the AI engages in a dialogue with the teacher, listening to their input and feedback throughout the question development process. This approach ensures that the generated questions meet the teacher's expectations and are tailored to the specific needs of their students.

COSEAQ S utilizes a series of microprompts to guide the question development process. These microprompts provide a structured approach to generating study questions across various difficulty levels, incorporating detailed feedback for each response. The microprompts amiing to generate questions that are comprehensive, curriculum-aligned, and create varied and differentiated types of study questions.

The background of COSEAQ S is rooted in the COSEAQ framework, which emphasizes the importance of dialogically scaffolding the educational content creation process. By engaging teachers in a dialogue and incorporating their expertise, COSEAQ S aims to create study questions that effectively support student learning and assessment.

To initiate the study question development process, educators start by uploading course content (see COSEAQ C), teaching materials, and course criteria, including the National Curriculum (NC). COSEAQ S prompts teachers to focus on one concept or area at a time to ensure depth and relevance in question creation.

## The execution steps in COSEAQ S are divided into three main phases:

### I. Dialogically Developing Questions with the Teacher
In this phase, the AI engages in a dialogue with the teacher to develop study questions. The process consists of three steps:

1. Analyze: Based on the uploaded documents, the AI analyzes the course content, syllabus, and NC to generate 10 questions that align with the educational requirements.

2. Question Formulation: The AI generates 10 study questions and asks for the teacher's feedback. This step is repeated until the teacher is satisfied with the questions and confirms that they align with the course content. The questions are developed to assess students' understanding of concepts, navigate subject-specific terminology, and cover multiple cognitive levels based on grading criteria.

3. Detailed Semantic Feedback: For each question, the AI provides detailed feedback explaining the rationale behind the correct answer and the reasoning for each distractor's design. This feedback aims to clarify ambiguities, correct misconceptions, and reinforce concept understanding.

### II. Formulation of Diverse Study Questions
In this phase, the AI creates study questions at different levels and with significant variation. It generates a set of study questions that vary in structure and focus, avoiding repetition and encouraging comprehensive coverage of the concept. Additionally, it develops a series of 10 study questions for each grade level, tailored to progressively challenge students and deepen their understanding.

### III. Differentiation Types of Study Questions
In the final phase, COSEAQ S focuses on creating differentiated types of study questions to cater to diverse learning needs and styles. This phase is crucial for ensuring that the generated questions effectively engage students with different learning preferences and abilities, promoting a more inclusive and comprehensive learning experience.

The differentiation of study questions is based on the understanding that students have varied strengths, interests, and ways of processing information. By providing a range of question types, COSEAQ S aims to create a more equitable and effective assessment experience that allows all students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills.

The three main types of differentiated study questions generated by COSEAQ S are:

1. **Scenario-Based Questions:** These questions present students with real-world scenarios or case studies related to the course content. Students are required to apply their knowledge and critical thinking skills to analyze the situation, make decisions, or solve problems. Scenario-based questions help students develop practical skills and understand the relevance of the course content in real-life contexts.

2. **Open-Ended Questions:** Open-ended questions require students to provide more extensive and thoughtful responses, moving beyond simple recall or recognition of information. These questions encourage students to express their understanding, opinions, and ideas in their own words. Open-ended questions promote deeper engagement with the course content and allow students to demonstrate their ability to articulate and elaborate on their knowledge.

3. **Critical Thinking Questions:** Critical thinking questions challenge students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information from various sources. These questions often involve comparing and contrasting ideas, evaluating arguments, or making judgments based on evidence. Critical thinking questions help students develop higher-order thinking skills, such as logical reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

By incorporating these differentiated question types, COSEAQ S ensures that the generated study questions cater to a wide range of learning needs and styles. This approach promotes a more engaging and effective learning experience, as students have the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in ways that align with their strengths and preferences.

Moreover, the differentiation of study questions supports the development of a well-rounded understanding of the course content. By exposing students to various question types, COSEAQ S encourages them to engage with the material from multiple perspectives, deepening their comprehension and retention of key concepts.

In summary, the differentiation of study questions in COSEAQ S is a critical aspect of creating a comprehensive and inclusive learning experience. By generating scenario-based, open-ended, and critical thinking questions, COSEAQ S ensures that the study questions cater to diverse learning needs and styles, promoting deeper engagement, understanding, and the development of essential skills.
