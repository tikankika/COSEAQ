A CustomGPT in OpenAI:s GPT4 - link to the GPT: [Content Generation from Syllabus and N.C. - COSEAQ C](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-3RBJxzYB1-content-generation-from-syllabus-and-n-c-coseaq-c) 

## *The Content Generation COSEAQ C -  to facilitate teachers' process of interpreting, clarifying, and converting the Syllabus and National Curriculum into actionable Course content. The Course Content generated is meant to lay the groundwork for utilizing AI in creating textbooks, quiz questions..., and notably, for enabling students to integrate this content into their studies through their own "AI-StudyBuddy."*

This Content Generation is part of the framework *COSEAQ*, consisting of interconnected Custom GPT:s that can be utilized within the same thread [for further information](https://community.openai.com/t/search-all-gpts-in-chat-with-recent-and-pinned-gpts/604356).

COSEAQ C utilizes **"micro-prompts"** both as procedural aids and as a means to initiate discussions about the content. These micro-prompts play a crucial role in guiding the content generation process, ensuring that the output is not only relevant but also aligned with educational standards and objectives. 

**Objective:** Leverage a structured approach, detailed "Instructions", to cultivate Course Content systematically. This involves a dynamic engagement with the Syllabus and National Curriculum. This concept revolves around Custom GPT with micro-prompts to generate concise, curriculum-aligned content.

**Initiation:** To start the content creation cycle, please upload "your" syllabus and national curriculum documents.  

## Content Generation Process Detailed Structure:

**Constructive Alignment:** Analyze the Syllabus and National Curriculum within the Constructive Alignment Framework to identify essential competencies, knowledge areas, and skills. This step ensures the relevance and educational alignment of the course content.

**Outline Creation:** Formulate a comprehensive course content outline, setting a factual and direct tone for the content, enhancing clarity and student comprehension.

**Chapter Development:** Structure and draft chapters that are engaging, informative, and curriculum-aligned, integrating key concepts effectively.

**Content Writing:** Follow the defined structure for each chapter, enriching them with relevant examples, diagrams, and visuals, guided by "micro-prompts".

*Beta!* (**Evaluation and Updates:** Establish protocols for content accuracy and recommend periodic updates to keep the course content current and scientifically accurate.)
